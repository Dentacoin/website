                    <p class="offset-top-50"> This Privacy Policy applies to the Dentacoin B.V. owned and operated applications, websites and its subdomains (“Sites and Applications”). Dentacoin B.V. (“Dentacoin” “we,” or “us”) knows that you care how information about you is used, stored, and shared.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what personal data of yours will be collected by us when you access the Sites and Applications, how the data will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of data.</p>
                    <p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy complies with the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. We will not use or share your personal data with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>The use of personal data collected through our Sites and Applications shall be limited to the purposes under this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <h5><strong>1. Data Protection Overview</strong></h5>
                    <p>The operators of all Dentacoin Sites and Applications take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>If you use any of our Sites and Applications, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
                    <p>Please note that data transmitted via the Internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
                    <h4>Who is responsible for the data collection on our Sites and Applications?</h4>
                    <p>The data collected on our Sites and Applications is processed by the Data Operator. The operator's contact details can be found in the legal notice on Dentacoin’s official website www.dentacoin.com.</p>
                    <p>Dentacoin Foundation operates the majority of its services as a data controller. However, there are some instances in which we operate as a data processor - e.g. in cases of surveys published on DentaVox, which are ordered by third-parties.</p>
                    <h4>How do we collect your data?</h4>
                    <p>We collect data when you register, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey, or send an inquiry.</p>
                    <p>Part of this data (including your name, email, phone number, friend list) is provided by third parties (such as Facebook, Civic, uPort) during the registration process, upon your explicit consent.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other data is collected automatically by our IT systems when you visit our Sites and Applications (primarily technical data such as which browser and operating system you are using, when you accessed the website, etc.).</p>
                    <h4>What do we use your data for? </h4>
                    <p>We collect your data in order to:</p>
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li>ensure the proper functioning of our Sites and Applications;</li>
                        <li>give you access to the full range of functionalities (such as answering questionnaires and earning Dentacoin tokens, writing reviews, using the Dentacare mobile app, etc.);</li>
                        <li>answer your inquiries;</li>
                        <li>send you service information and newsletters;</li>
                        <li>conduct market research;</li>
                        <li>analyze the overall user behaviour.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We will not sell, rent, or lease your personal data to any third party individual, government agency, or company at any time unless compelled to do so by law.</p>
                    <h4>How do we protect your data?</h4>
                    <p>Your personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. </p>
                    <p>All sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties. </p>
                    <p>We use regular Malware Scanning. We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
                    <h4>How long do we keep your data?</h4>
                    <p>Your data is retained until you explicitly express that you want us to delete your data or you delete it on your own using the designated option in your Profile on our Sites and Applications. By deleting your Profile on our Sites and Applications you are exercising your right “to be forgotten” and we have the obligation to erase your personal data. </p>
                    <h5><strong>2. What rights do you have regarding you data</strong></h5>
                    <p>You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge. You also have the right to request it to be corrected, restricted, or deleted (those options are available to you in Your profile as well). You can contact us at any time using the address given in the legal notice if you have further questions about the issue of privacy and data protection. You may also, of course, file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.</p>
                    <h4>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h4>
                    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email expressing this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
                    <h4>Information, restriction, deletion</h4>
                    <p>You have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed. You also have the right to have this data corrected, restricted or deleted (those options are available to you in Your profile as well). You can contact us at any time using the email address given in our legal notice if you have further questions related to your personal data.</p>
                    <h4>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h4>
                    <p>If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a
                        complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.</p>
                    <h4>Right to data portability</h4>
                    <p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a
                        contract delivered to yourself or to a third
                        party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to
                        another responsible party, this will only be
                        done to the extent technically feasible. </p>
                    <h4>Analytics and third-party tools</h4>
                    <p>When visiting our Sites and Applications, statistical analyses may be made of your surfing
                        behavior. This happens primarily using
                        cookies and analytics tools. The analysis of your surfing behavior is usually anonymous,
                        i.e. we will not be able to
                        identify your identity from this data. When created, cookies normally don't contain any
                        personal information.
                        They don't scan your computer or do any kind of investigation to find out your personal
                        information. Any personal
                        information they might contain is a result of your own input on a website's form. Most of
                        the time, when a cookie does
                        store personal information, this information is coded in such a way that it is unreadable to
                        any third party who happens
                        to access your cookie folder. </p>
                    <p>You can object to this analysis. We will inform you further below about how to exercise your
                        options in this regard.</p>
                    <h5><strong>3. Data Collection</strong></h5>
                    <h4>Account Data</h4>
                    <p>Personal data such as email address, age, city, country, mobile phone number is requested
                        from you when registering
                        on any of our Sites and Applications. This data is collected to ensure the proper
                        functioning of our Sites and
                        Applications; it allows you to access certain parts of our Sites and Applications, to use
                        the full range of
                        functionalities they offer (such as answering DentaVox questionnaires, earning Dentacoin
                        tokens, writing reviews
                        on our Trusted Review Platform, enhancing your oral hygiene routine by means of the
                        Dentacare mobile app, etc.),
                        as well as to receive service information and newsletters. Other data can be used to analyze
                        how you use our Sites
                        and Applications, as well as for market research purposes.</p>
                    <p>For account creation, verification and login we use the services of third-party service
                        providers - Facebook, Civic and uPort.</p>
                    <h4>Facebook Login </h4>
                    <p>Our Sites and Applications use Facebook Login. The service is provided by Facebook Inc., 1601
                        S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").
                    </p>
                    <p>Facebook Login allows you to quickly and easily create an account and login without having to
                        set (and likely later forget)
                        another password. When creating your account on our Sites and Applications, you will be
                        asked for specific permissions about
                        the data you allow us to use from your Facebook profile. No other data from your Facebook
                        profile will be collected without your explicit consent. </p>
                    <p>You can discontinue at any time the integration of your Facebook profile with our Sites and
                        Applications or edit your permissions by following the
                        instructions specified here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/262314300536014">https://www.facebook.com/help/262314300536014/</a>

                    <h4>Civic Login </h4>
                    <p>Our Sites and Applications use Civic for account creation and verification. The service is
                        provided by Civic Technologies,
                        Inc., 540 Bryant Street, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94301, United States. </p>
                    <p>Civic allows you to register and authenticate without the need for usernames and passwords,
                        and verify your identity using blockchain-powered
                        attestations. Users store their identity data, documents and attestations using the Civic
                        App and can reuse the attestations when needed. When
                        creating your account on our Sites and Applications, you will be asked for specific
                        permissions about the data you allow us to use from your Civic
                        decentralized ID. No other data from your Civic ID will be collected without your explicit
                        consent. </p>
                    <p>Please check out Civic's privacy policy to learn more: <a

                    <h4>uPort Login</h4>
                    <p>Our Sites and Applications use uPort for account creation and verification. uPort is
                        developed and powered by ConsenSys Corporation, based in Brooklyn,
                        New York City, USA. </p>
                    <p>uPort provides a digital identity platform and application which enable users to control
                        their own identity and accounts, secure their keys, manage
                        and give permission to their personal data, and legally sign transactions. When creating
                        your account on our Sites and Applications, you will
                        be asked for specific permissions about the data you allow us to retrieve and use from your
                        uPort decentralized ID. No other data from your uPort
                        ID will be collected without your explicit consent. </p>
                    <p>Please check out uPort's privacy policy to learn more: <a

                    <h4>Cookies</h4>
                    <p>Some of our Sites and Applications use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not
                        contain any viruses.
                        Cookies help make our Sites and Applications more user-friendly, efficient, and secure.
                        Cookies are small text files
                        that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most of the cookies we use are the so-called "session cookies". They are automatically
                        deleted after you leave our websites and
                        their subdomains. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them.. These
                        cookies enable our websites to recognize your
                        browser (device) and previous activity the next time you visit them.</p>
                    <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide
                        on a case-by-case basis whether to accept
                        or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept
                        cookies under certain conditions or to always
                        reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies
                        may limit the functionality of our Sites and Applications.</p>
                    <p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain
                        functions you wish to use are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1,
                        letter f of GDPR. The Sites and Applications’ operator has a legitimate interest in the
                        storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free
                        of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior)
                        are also stored, they will be treated separately in this Privacy
                        Policy.</p>
                    <h4>Server log files</h4>
                    <p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser
                        automatically transmits to us in "server log files". These are:</p>
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li>Browser type and browser version</li>

                        <li>Referrer URL
                        </li>
                        <li>Host name of the accessing computer
                        </li>
                        <li>Time of the server request

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p>
                    <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to
                        fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.</p>
                    <h4>Contact forms and Online chat</h4>
                    <p>Should you send us questions via contact forms or chats on our Sites and Applications, we
                        will collect the data entered, including the contact details you

                        information without your permission.</p>
                    <p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent
                        as per Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time.
                        An informal email expressing this request is sufficient. The data processed before we
                        receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
                    <p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion or
                        revoke your consent for its storage. Any mandatory statutory provisions,
                        especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this
                        provision.</p>

                        reasons (slander, etc.).</p>
                    <p>The comments are stored based on your consent as per Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You may revoke your
                        consent at any time with future effect. An informal
                        email expressing this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your
                        request may still be legally processed.

                    <h5><strong>4. Data Collected for Market Research Purposes</strong></h5>
                    <p>We collect data for market research purposes from subscribers (data subjects) taking
                        incentivized online surveys on our market research platform DentaVox.
                        The collection and use of personal data (incl. survey answers) on DentaVox is performed in
                        compliance with the GDPR Guidance Note for the Research Sector,
                        compiled jointly by the European Research Federation (EFAMRO) and ESOMAR - the global voice
                        of the data, research and insights community. </p>
                    <p>All surveys taken as well as the respective answers given by a respondent are associated with
                        her/his DentaVox account. Hence they can also be considered personal data (in terms of
                        database / storage).
                        The respondent can request all this data (both personal details and survey answers) to be
                        edited, withdrawn or deleted at any time by contacting us at the email
                        provided in the legal notice or using the designated options in their online Profile.</p>
                    <p>If the survey responses, however, have already been incorporated and anonymized or aggregated
                        in a market, opinion or social research project (like it is in the case of DentaVox), then
                        this data does
                        not have to be deleted as it’s not personal data. The aggregated and anonymized survey
                        results can hence be provided to third parties such as partners, media, etc.</p>
                    <p>If a participant communicates his/her opposition to the processing of his/her data, we will
                        facilitate this by not further processing identification data.</p>
                    <h5><strong>5. Analytics and advertising</strong></h5>
                    <h4 style="color:#126585">Google Analytics</h4>
                    <p>Our Sites and Applications use Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by
                        Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
                    <p>Google Analytics uses the so-called "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your
                        device and that enable the us to analyze you user behaviour on our Sites and Applications.
                        The information generated by the cookie about your use is usually transmitted to a Google
                        server in the USA and stored there.</p>
                    <p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The Sites and Applications’
                        operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize online services
                        and advertising activities.</p>
                    <h4>IP anonymization</h4>
                    <p>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on our Sites and Applications. Your IP address
                        will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to
                        the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only
                        in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the
                        US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of our
                        Sites and Applications to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports
                        on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet
                        usage for the Sites and Applications’ operator . The IP address transmitted
                        by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by
                        Google.</p>
                    <h4>Browser plugin</h4>
                    <p>You can disable cookies / prevent the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate
                        settings in your browser. However, be aware that doing so you may not be able to enjoy
                        the full functionality of our Sites and Applications. You can also prevent the data
                        generated by cookies about your use of Dentacoin websites (incl. your IP address)
                        from being passed to and processed by Google, by downloading and installing the browser

                    </p>
                    <h4>Demographic data collection by Google Analytics</h4>
                    <p>Our Sites and Applications use Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to
                        be generated containing statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors.
                        This data comes from interest-based advertising
                        from Google and third-party visitor data. This collected data cannot be attributed to any
                        specific individual person. You can disable this feature at any time by
                        adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid the collection of your
                        data by Google Analytics as described in the section "Refusal of data collection".</p>
                    <h4>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</h4>
                    <p>Our Sites and Applications use Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program
                        developed by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View,
                        CA 94043, United States ("Google").</p>
                    <p>As part of Google AdWords services/tools, we use the so-called “conversion tracking”. When
                        you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small
                        text files that your internet browser stores on your computer.
                        These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user.
                        Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired,
                        Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that
                        page.</p>
                    <p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using
                        the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie
                        is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for
                        conversion tracking.
                        Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to
                        a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can
                        be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can
                        opt-out of this
                        by simply disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie in your browser settings. In doing
                        so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
                    <p>Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The Sites and Applications’
                        operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize user
                        experience and advertising.</p>
                    <p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google
                        Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?gl=de">

                    <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide
                        on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser
                        can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always
                        reject them, or to
                        automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the
                        functionality of our Sites and Applications.</p>
                    <h4>Google reCAPTCHA</h4>
                    <p>We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our Sites and Applications. This
                        service is provided by Google Inc.,
                        1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").</p>
                    <p>reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our Sites and Applications (e.g. a
                        contact or registration form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do
                        this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various
                        characteristics.
                        This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For
                        the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor
                        has been on the website, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the
                        analysis is then forwarded to Google.
                    </p>
                    <p>The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not
                        advised that such an analysis is taking place.</p>
                    <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The Sites and Applications’ operator has a
                        legitimate interest in protecting them from abusive automated crawling and spam.</p>
                    <p>For more information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy, please visit the

                    <h4>Facebook Pixel</h4>
                    <p>Our Sites and Applications measure conversions using visitor action pixels provided by
                        Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").</p>
                    <p>These pixels allow the tracking of site visitors’ behaviour after they click on a Facebook ad
                        to reach the provider's website. This allows an analysis of the effectiveness
                        of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and their future
                        optimization.</p>
                    <p>The data collected is anonymous to us as an operator of our Sites and Applications and we
                        cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities. However, the data are
                        stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and
                        which may use the data for its own
                        advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy. This will allow Facebook
                        to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We have no control over how this
                        data is used.</p>

                    <h5><strong>6. Newsletter and Service Information Emails</strong></h5>
                    <h4>Newsletter</h4>
                    <p>If you would like to receive our Newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as
                        information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address
                        and that you agree to receive this Newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only
                        collected on a
                        voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it
                        on to third parties.</p>
                    <p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent
                        as per Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email
                        address as well as their use for sending the Newsletter at any time, e.g. through the
                        "unsubscribe" link in the Newsletter.
                        The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
                    <p>The data you provide in the Newsletter sign-up form will be used for its regular distribution
                        until you cancel your subscription. If you decide to unsubscribe, the above mentioned data
                        will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes - e.g. email addresses of users that
                        have registered on
                        our Sites and Applications - remain unaffected.</p>
                    <p>For sending newsletters, we use the services of MailChimp, HubSpot and SendGrid.</p>
                    <h4>Service Information Emails</h4>
                    <p>If you want to register on our Sites and Applications, we require a valid email address that
                        allows us to send you service information - e.g. emails for verification that you are the
                        owner of this specified email address, notifications for certain actions taken on our Sites
                        and Applications, password reset links, etc. </p>
                    <p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the registration form only with your
                        consent as per Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and
                        email address as well as their use for sending service information at any time through
                        deleting your account. The data processed before we receive your request may still be
                        legally processed.</p>
                    <p>For sending service information emails, we use the services of SendGrid.</p>
                    <h4 style="color:#126585"><strong>Service Providers</strong></h4>
                    <h4>MailChimp</h4>
                    <p>Our Sites and Applications use the services of MailChimp to send newsletters.
                        This service is provided by The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite
                        5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.</p>
                    <p>MailChimp is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. If you
                        provide data (e.g. your email address)
                        to subscribe to our Newsletter, it will be stored on MailChimp servers in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>MailChimp is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy
                        Shield Framework.</p>
                    <p>We use MailChimp also to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent by
                        MailChimp, a file included in the email (called a web beacon) connects to MailChimp's
                        servers in the United States. This allows us to determine if a newsletter message has been
                        opened and which links you clicked on. In addition, technical
                        information is collected (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type, and operating
                        system). This information cannot be assigned to a specific recipient.
